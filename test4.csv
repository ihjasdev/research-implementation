elonmusk, DragTimes  Tesla Nice
elonmusk, grimnut  Tesla  WholeMarsBlog  DirtyTesla Haha
elonmusk, WholeMarsBlog You don t even need to touch the shifter in new S  Auto detect direction will come as an optional setting to all cars with FSD 
elonmusk, thePiggsBoson Problem 1st  theory 2nd is for sure way to go  as it establishes relevance  thus improving memory retention

elonmusk, ArtifactsHub OG Hipster
elonmusk, ValaAfshar Indeed
elonmusk, waitbutwhy Pohtaytohz
elonmusk, squawksquare Current Summon is sometimes useful  but mostly just a fun trick  Once we move summon  plus highway driving  to a single FSD stack  it will be sublime 
elonmusk, billycrammer  Tesla Cool 
elonmusk, engineers_feed There s a corner case where brick density is same density as water  reaching bottom due to momentum
elonmusk,Fred Astaire is incredible  Worth watching his movies  One of a kind 
elonmusk, ValaAfshar Haha
elonmusk, TrungTPhan Now  he can bench press a rhino
elonmusk, SamTwits Nice

elonmusk, lexfridman  All your basis points are belong to us    fiat issuers

elonmusk, techAU Roughly
elonmusk, JeffTutorials  TonyTesla4Life  WholeMarsBlog Yes
elonmusk, TonyTesla4Life  WholeMarsBlog Wide beta maybe with FSD rev 10  definitely with rev 11
elonmusk, fael097 Pure coincidence 
elonmusk, ValaAfshar Even smaller to a  neuralink chip

elonmusk, ErcXspace  NASASpaceflight  SpaceX Some of these design trades are still open  but will be resolved soon
elonmusk, ErcXspace  NASASpaceflight  SpaceX Very accurate 
elonmusk, Teslarati Improving permit approval speed  amp  lowering permit costs for solar would make a big difference
elonmusk, TeslaNY Do you even press 
elonmusk, enn_nafnlaus  jpr007  TesLatino  klwtts Indeed  but again like a parking lot  a battery having big  roads  tends to decrease number of  parking spaces   ie stores less energy 
elonmusk, RationalEtienne  etherkragg Those are major factors
elonmusk, AustinTeslaClub  SpaceX  austinbarnard45  PPathole  TeslaOwnersEBay  bluemoondance74  teslaownersSV  JohnnaCrider1  TeslaNY Absolutely 
elonmusk, Erdayastronaut  SpaceX Probably Monday
elonmusk, AaronS5_  FrenchieEAP  karpathy Yes
elonmusk, FrenchieEAP  karpathy FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving  Beta 10 hopefully  Beta 11 definitely  will use one stack to rule them all   city streets  highway  amp  complex parking lots 
elonmusk, Erdayastronaut  Model3Owners How about a wifi camera link 
elonmusk, BLKMDL3  Model3Owners In end  we kept production design almost exactly same as show car  Just some small tweaks here  amp  there to make it slightly better   No door handles  Car recognizes you  amp  opens door   Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling  amp  tight turns 
elonmusk, johnkrausphotos  SpaceX  PortCanaveral Version 3 of the SpaceX droneship  Team did great work  Will be epic to see the deep sea oil rigs converted to ocean spaceports for Starship 
elonmusk, Model3Owners To be frank  there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop  because it is so unlike anything else    I don t care  I love it so much even if others don t    Other trucks look like copies of the same thing  but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future 
elonmusk, TesLatino  klwtts  jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen  as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full  parking lot     Just like a car parking lot  where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full 
elonmusk, jpr007 Not bad  although new Model S has more range  amp  faster charging  3  amp  Y should use long range version  as Performance version is meant for max speed  amp  handling  not max range    Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW  so that will help too 
elonmusk, AdrianoinJapan  Kristennetten Yeah  I wuz running on almost no sleep
elonmusk, Kristennetten Yup
elonmusk, TeslaGong  ajtourville  PPathole  Adamklotz_  AaronS5_  crheller  SpaceX Some traffic could just go terminal   gt  satellite   gt  satellite   gt  terminal and never touch the regular Internet
elonmusk, JxckSweeney  jack Good point
elonmusk, ajtourville  PPathole  Adamklotz_  AaronS5_  crheller  SpaceX If we can do this successfully  then anything developed for ground undersea fiber is automatically better in orbit
elonmusk, ajtourville  PPathole  Adamklotz_  AaronS5_  crheller  SpaceX Similar to fiber optic  We are trying to ride the terrestrial fiber optic laser technology forcing function  but modified for use in vacuum 
elonmusk, PPathole Yeah
elonmusk, PPathole  Adamklotz_  AaronS5_  crheller  SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long distance latency by as much as 50   due to higher speed of light in vacuum  amp  shorter path than undersea fiber
elonmusk, Adamklotz_  AaronS5_  crheller  SpaceX More ground stations  amp  less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences   Looking at speed of light as  300km per millisecond  amp  satellite altitude of  550km  average photon round trip time is only  10ms  so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping  gt 20ms 
elonmusk, jack     A new laughing emoji on DMs would be great
elonmusk, crheller  SpaceX Glad it s working  The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering  production  amp  launch teams is amazing    Ping should improve dramatically in coming months  We re aiming for  lt 20ms  Basically  you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink

elonmusk, TeslaOwnersEBay  Kristennetten  RationalEtienne  EvaFoxU  JohnnaCrider1  TeslaChillMode  CodingMark  Model3Owners  WholeMarsBlog  AustinTeslaClub I m trying to set a good example  Population collapse is a much bigger problem than people realize and that s just for Earth   Mars has a great need for people  seeing as population is currently zero   Humans are the custodians of other life on Earth  Let us bring life to Mars 
elonmusk, preachy_spice It was Richard s rental house  which overall is great  but I agree regarding the cabinets haha  This was 3am  day of flight  Wasn t expecting this brutal pic of me to be posted  but oh well

elonmusk, YounieTyler  astro_g_dogg Booster is more than half cost of mission  Fairing is  10  
elonmusk, bluewalletio Any money transmitter or other licenses needed to use this in USA 
elonmusk, astro_g_dogg Took more work to make F9 booster reuse cost effective than went into recovering it in the first place  This is an important point   Things finally clicked into place with Block 5  My hat is off to everyone at SpaceX  NASA  Space Force  FAA  amp  suppliers who helped make it happen 
elonmusk, Kale6360gmail I m actually 3000 years old  but  at the risk of being immodest  I think I look good even for 2500 years  Still have my original chariot license in papyrus

elonmusk, wapodavenport Spaceport design is cool
elonmusk, vincent13031925 Final decision made earlier this week on booster engine count  Will be 33 at  230  half million lbs  sea level thrust  All engines on booster are same  apart from deleting gimbal  amp  thrust vector actuators for outer 20 
elonmusk, richardbranson  virgingalactic Congratulations  beautiful flight 
elonmusk, richardbranson  virgingalactic Godspeed 
elonmusk, SciGuySpace Yes  It will be the highest output  amp  most advanced rocket engine factory in the world 
elonmusk, WatchersTank  Erdayastronaut The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor
elonmusk, austinbarnard45 Thanks Austin   
elonmusk, GokuAurelius  Erdayastronaut Roughly 800 to 1000 per year  That s about what s needed over ten years to create the fleet to build a self sustaining city on Mars  City itself probably takes roughly 20 years  so hopefully it is built by  2050
